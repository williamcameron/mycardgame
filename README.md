Beginnings of TDD Card Game

Based on MTG - [Comprehensive Rules](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/resources/rules/MagicCompRules_21031101.pdf) and Card Library from [The Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx).

All rules, names, logic, images, mechanics and anything that isn't mine copyright and trademark Wizards.   THis is purely a hobby project and not intended to upset anyone :) (Just saying).

Building up using BDD and TDD methodologies to work from cards in decks and slowly introduce mechanics and rules as we go along.
